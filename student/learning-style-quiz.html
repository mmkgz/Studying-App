        <h1>Visual</h1>
As a visual learner you grasp information through reading or visual aids and remember by sight. You prefer visual learning methods and are neat and clean. Visualizing concepts is natural for you, and you might close your eyes for recall. When bored, you seek visual stimuli but may struggle with spoken directions and get distracted by sounds. Richly visual content, including colorful imagery and vivid stories, attracts your attention.
Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:
Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)
Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.
Use flashcards to learn new words.
Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.
Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.
Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.
Color code things.
Avoid distractions during study times.
Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.

      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;display:none" id="tactilea">
        <h1>Tactile</h1>
Tactile learners prefer hands-on activities, physical movement, and learning through touch. You excel when engaged in active, dynamic learning experiences, often requiring breaks, and may find it challenging to sit still.

As a tactile learner, you enjoy hands-on activities such as dismantling and assembling things. When you are bored, you tend to tinker or move around. Your good coordination and athletic ability stand out. While you easily recall actions, visual or auditory information might be challenging. Touch is your preferred communication style, and you appreciate physical forms of encouragement, like a pat on the back.
 Try to connect information with movements to learn and retain information better. 

Here are some things that tactile learners like you can do to learn better:

Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving, or drawing.
Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories.
It's okay to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or studying.
Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships between ideas.
Trace words with your finger to learn spelling (finger spelling).
Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long).
It's okay to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning.
Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch.
Remember that you learn best by doing, not just by reading, seeing, or hearing.

      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:20%;margin-right:20%;display:none" id="auditorya">
        <h1>Auditory</h1>
As an auditory learner, you grasp information best through hearing. Reading aloud helps you learn, and you might hum or talk when you become bored. You absorb and understand spoken information more effectively than others. Try to use this to your advantage by understanding and paying attention. 
Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.
Sit where you can hear the information being shared. 
Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.
Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud.
Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.
Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.
Have test questions read to you out loud so that you can answer them with better comprehension.
Study new material by reading it out loud. 
Try using headphones often and practice explaining topics to others as a study method. 
Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, to learn well.
